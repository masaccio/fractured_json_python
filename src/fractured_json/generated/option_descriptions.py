FLAG_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    "allow_trailing_commas": "If true, the final element in an array or object in the input may have a comma after it; otherwise an exception is thrown. The JSON standard doesn't allow trailing commas, but some other tools allow them, so the option is provided for interoperability with them.",
    "always_expand_depth": "Forces elements close to the root to always fully expand, regardless of other settings.",
    "colon_padding": "If true, a space is added after a colon.",
    "comma_padding": "If true, a space is added after a comma.",
    "comment_padding": "If true, a space is added between a prefix/postfix comment and the element to which it is attached.",
    "comment_policy": "Determines how comments should be handled. The JSON standard doesn't allow comments, but as an unofficial extension they are fairly wide-spread and useful.",
    "indent_spaces": "Indents by this number of spaces for each level of depth.",
    "json_eol_style": "Determines which sort of line endings to use.",
    "max_compact_array_complexity": "Maximum nesting level that can be arranged spanning multiple lines, with multiple items per line.",
    "max_inline_complexity": "The maximum nesting level that can be displayed on a single line. A primitive type or an empty array or object has a complexity of 0. An object or array has a complexity of 1 greater than its most complex child.",
    "max_inline_length": "Like max_total_line_length , this is used to limit how much gets put onto one line. But this one doesn't count indentation. You might use this instead of max_total_line_length if you want to be sure that similar structures at different depths are formatted the same.",
    "max_table_row_complexity": "Maximum nesting level allowed as a row of a table-formatted array/object.",
    "max_total_line_length": "Maximum length of a line, including indentation and everything, for purposes of deciding how much to pile together.",
    "min_compact_array_row_items": "Minimum number of items per line to be eligible for compact-multiline-array formatting.",
    "nested_bracket_padding": "If true, a space is added between an array/object's brackets and its contents, if that array/object has a complexity of 2 or more. That is, if it contains non-empty arrays/objects.",
    "number_list_alignment": "Controls how lists or table columns that contain only numbers and nulls are aligned. ",
    "omit_trailing_whitespace": "If true, the generated JSON text won't have spaces at the ends of lines. If omit_trailing_whitespace is false and comma_padding is true, often lines will end in a space.",
    "prefix_string": "A string to be included at the start of every line of output. Note that if this string is anything other than whitespace, it will probably make the output invalid as JSON.",
    "preserve_blank_lines": "If true, blank lines",
    "simple_bracket_padding": "If true, a space is added between an array/object's brackets and its contents, if that array/object has a complexity of 1. That is, if it only contains primitive elements and/or empty arrays/objects.",
    "table_comma_placement": "Where to place commas in table-formatted elements.",
    "use_tab_to_indent": "If true, a single tab character is used to indent, instead of spaces.",
